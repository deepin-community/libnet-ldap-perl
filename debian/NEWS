libnet-ldap-perl (1:0.5700-1) unstable; urgency=low

  COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
  The bug fix "LDAP.pm: new parameter bind(sasl_host => SASLHOST)"
  is an incompatible change that may break some corner-case configurations
  * that use SASL for authentication and
  * where the SASL host name differs from the host name connecting to.

  The incompatible change was necessary as it was not possible to fix
  the issue which was introduced in perl-ldap 0.37 in a compatible way.

  See Net::LDAP's manual page for the details on "sasl_host".
